## **Overview**

Scoutrix is a standardized AI-powered athlete verification and recruitment infrastructure built for rural India.

It replaces geography-dependent physical trials with AI-based digital performance evaluation, allowing athletes to be discovered purely based on measurable performance.

---

## **The Problem**

India has over 50 crore rural citizens. Athletic talent exists everywhere. Structured discovery does not.

**Current ecosystem limitations:**

- Trials are geography-dependent  
- No standardized performance documentation  
- Manual filtering by recruiters  
- Rural athletes lack visibility  
- Inconsistent benchmarking across districts  

**Result:** Talent loss before development.

---

## **Our Solution**

Two roles. One performance-driven ecosystem.

### **Athlete Flow**

1. Record performance on any Android device  
2. Upload video  
3. AI extracts sport-specific metrics locally  
4. SPI (Standardized Performance Index) generated  
5. Athlete appears on verified leaderboard  

### **Recruiter Flow**

1. Input requirements  
2. Filter verified athletes  
3. Automated Recruitment Engine ranks profiles  
4. Download shortlist report instantly  

---

## **Core Features**

### **AI Video Analysis**
MediaPipe Pose Detection via TensorFlow.js extracts biomechanical and sport-specific metrics locally from raw phone footage. Performance metrics are rendered directly onto video frames efficiently on the device without backend computing.

### **Standardized Performance Index (SPI)**
Age, gender, and sport-normalized scoring engine enabling fair comparison across regions.

### **Pivoting Stickman Biomechanics**
Frame-by-frame movement comparison with professional reference models to highlight deviations.

### **Automated Recruitment Engine**
Requirement-based athlete ranking system generating downloadable reports.

### **Sport-wise Leaderboard**
Filter by sport, age group, gender, state, and district.

### **Explore Narrative Engine**
Live performance narratives generated using Google Gemini.

### **Offline-First Design**
Local capture and AI inference directly on the device. Syncs metadata securely to the cloud.

---

## **Sports Supported (Phase 1)**

### **Cricket**
- Bowling speed  
- Batting reaction time  
- Throw distance  

### **Football**

```
## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

- Node.js v18+  
- MongoDB  

### **Backend Setup**

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```
*Note: Ensure your MongoDB server is running.*

### **Frontend Setup**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### **Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory based on these requirements:
```
PORT=3000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
MONGODB_URI=
JWT_SECRET=
GEMINI_API_KEY=
IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY=
IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY=
IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT=
```

Create a `.env` in the `frontend` directory if required by your client code (e.g., matching backend routes).

## **Roadmap**

**Phase 1**
Cricket, Football, Badminton across 3 states

**Phase 2**
10 sports across 28 states
Federation partnerships

**Phase 3**
National athlete registry
Khelo India integration
SAI academy pipeline

---

## **Vision**

Scoutrix is not a sports app.

It is a digital infrastructure layer for India’s grassroots sports ecosystem.

Discovery should depend on performance — not postcode.

Talent has no address.
